    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A meal I would often looked forward to after a long day of school and after school activities; one of the many dishes my mother used to prepare just for me.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta, in this case, spaghetti</li>
        <li>500 gr. of ground beef</li>
        <li>An onion</li>
        <li>2-3 carrots</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely dice the onion and carrots</li>
        <li>Olive oil the pan and put it on medium heat</li>
        <li>Toss the diced vegetables in the pan and let them simmer for a while</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper the ground beef</li>
        <li>As soon as the vegetables are softened up a bit insert the ground beef in the pan with the vegetables</li>
        <li>Remember to break up the ground beef as it sears so it doesn't clump together</li>
        <li>When the ground beef has turned from pink to grey it's time to add the tomato sauce and lower the heat</li>
        <li>Stir and let it sit for 2-3 minutes and you're all done!</li>
    </ol>
