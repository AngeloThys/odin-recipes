    <h2 class="recipe-parts-headers">Steps</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Slice and dice the vegetables according to your liking.</li>
            <li>Mix the ground pork and beef with the mixture of spices and form balls the size of around 70-100 grams (they should fit in your hand).</li>
            <li>Butter the pan on medium to high heat, as soon as the pan is hot put 2 to 3 balls in the pan and smash them with the help of a spatula.</li>
            <li>As soon as they start to brown on one side turn them over and top them off with 1 or 2 slices of your cheese of choice and let them get some color on the other side.</li>
            <li>Whilst the burgers are doing their thing, grab a small cup and mix some equal parts of mayo, ketchup, mustard and a little bit of pickle juice. This will be the sauce for our burgers.</li>
            <li>When the burgers are done butter the buns and put them on the pan on medium to high heat for 30-45 seconds.</li>
            <li>Finally, assemble the perfect burger! Sauce up both buns with some sauce, put on the lettuce, onion, tomato, pickles and the burger(s) with cheese and voil√°!</li>
